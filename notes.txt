Need to work on being able to iterate through every spotify artist as quickly as
possible.

Need to work out if I can use the spaces (e.g. %20) to make spotify recognise
the query string as a key word, and only give me artists that include it.
Is there such a thing as a "starts with" or a wildcard option?
